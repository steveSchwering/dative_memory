# dative_memory
Analysis of dative recall experiments. In these experiments, we looked at the ways in which verbal working memory is influenced by lexico-syntactic constraints: properties of words and their contexts that jointly interact to influence language comprehension and production. Specifically, we looked at constraints that influence dative sentence production; sentences like, "The chemist gave the man the book." Across these experiments, we manipulated three factors: part-of-speech, verb biases, and subject noun animacy. 

Across these experiments, we generated stimuli that were carefully controlled on several dimensions by trying to minimize Euclidean distance of dimensions like character length, frequency, and contextual diversity between manipulated words. For example, the part-of-speech manipulation can be observed here:

Generation of stimuli for each experiment can be found in each experiment's folder under the subfolder `stimulus_generation`. Analysis of each experiment's data can be found in each experiment's `analysis` subfolder. Note, in `stimulus_generation`, references are made to (Brysbaert norms)[https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BRM.41.4.977], which have not been copied to this repository. Also, raw data for analyses is not included and can instead be found on [this](https://osf.io/6gtnk/) OSF repository.

The results were pretty interesting, as shown below!

Experiment 1: Manipulations of part-of-speech

(e.g. in green: "responsible chemist **awarded** ridiculous director chair"; in black: "responsible chemist **railing** ridiculous director chair")

(e.g. in green: "fresh author **awarded** romantic director barrel"; in black: "fresh author **coughed** romantic director barrel")
